1.01
	added namespace shifting (all classnames - where possible -  are used from global namespace, and all Camarera and
		application classes shall be shifted into this global, if they dont exist already. Thus, all core classes are
		overrideable simply by defining them in the global namespace, and they can extend the namespaced classes...
	added Camarera::shiftClass() to shift a class one namespace up
	changed all reference of classnames to static (except type hinting where not applicable)
	fixed bug with loggers of array('Classname', 'methodName') types
	updated documentation
	added conf support
	changed bootstrap in favour of confs
	made composer compatible
	logging made PSR3 compatible
	added classlist.php (class lookup file for IDEs so they "understand" class shifting)
	changed Util class so it uses multibyte string functions
