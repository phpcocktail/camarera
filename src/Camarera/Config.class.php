/**
 * Base config class, convenient to extend and thus form data containers. Configs do:
 *
 *  * ensure easy and clear inline-creation of configurables (by chained setXxx() methods)
 *
 *  * should be used in place of config arrays, for real configuration-like usage, or just as enclosing params to a method
 *
 *  * should be used in usage scope (in the object/method it is passed to), and not directly (eg. don't molest a Model's
 *  	Field->$default unless you have reason,)
 *
 * 	* have real properties defined in PHP, public or protected (tip: use @property docs for easy autocomplete)
 *
 *  * by default, properties with names like $someThing are considered config properties (see $_fieldNameMask)
 *
 *  * protected properties are also exposed for getting, but not for setting (can be set through setProperty(), though)
 *  	protected properties can be accessed by $Object->propertyName instead of declared $_propertyName
 *
 *  * magic getXxx()/setXxx()/addXxx(), latter two can be chained for "fluid" objects
 *
 *  * you can define your getter/setter/magic methods over some properties and thus override default behaviour (eg.
 *		value checking or converting if necessary)
