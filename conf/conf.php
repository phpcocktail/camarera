/**
 * Camarera provides a common interface to configuration settings. Confs are multidimensional arrays, and their values
 *		are retrieved scoped, by means of module and environment. These scopes are cascaded, by retrieval or by load.
 * Confs must be loaded first
 * @see Camarera::loadConf()
 * loadConf will load the default file, and then look for environment specific one, loading it as well. It merges
 *		values with the original ones, overwriting originals. This config array is stored in Camarera::$_confCache. This
 *		is environment scoping and is resolved at load time. Note that merging is done by array_merge_recursive so
 *		arrays with numerical indices will be merged, not overwritten.
 * Values can be got by
 * @see Camarera::conf($key)
 * confs are sometimes mapped to Config objects, eg. the App.App.* config maps to the \Cocktail\ApplicationConfig class,
 *		but this is not mandatory. In these cases, the class definition (variables) define what the conf can contain.
 * Lazy loading: any element in the config array can be a lambda callback function. These may return one value or a
 *		multi-dimensional array. Using lambdas is useful when a config item depends on another, eg. an autoloader uses
 *		the localRoot config value. In these cases the lambda can reference the already loaded config, while plain code
 *		would be executed before any config value gets into the config cache.
 * There are four important, special elements in each config (but all can be omitted)
 *	1. the first chunk (key) must contain all common module dependent settings, eg. 'localRoot'. These chunks can be
 * 		reached in a cascading way, eg. \Camarera::conf('.env') will get the latest loaded value of these first chunks.
 *  2. '_autoloader' items of this array will be registered as autoloaders when the config file is loaded
 *  3. '_logger' items will be registered as well
 *  4. '_store' items will be registered as well
